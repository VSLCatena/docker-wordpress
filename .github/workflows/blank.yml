# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the master branch
  push:
    branches: [ dev ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  vm-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    services:
      mongodb:
        image: mongo
        ports:
        # will assign a random free host port

    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
